A Terraform workspace is a feature in Terraform that allows you to manage multiple instances of your infrastructure with isolated state files. Workspaces are a way to organize different environments or configurations within a single Terraform configuration, such as separating development, staging, and production environments. They provide a way to manage different configurations without needing to create separate directories for each environment.
